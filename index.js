/**
 * Serverless Plugin Boilerplate
 * - Useful example/starter code for writing a plugin for the Serverless Framework.
 * - In a plugin, you can:
 *    - Create a Custom Action that can be called via the CLI or programmatically via a function handler.
 *    - Overwrite a Core Action that is included by default in the Serverless Framework.
 *    - Add a hook that fires before or after a Core Action or a Custom Action
 *    - All of the above at the same time :)
 *
 * - Setup:
 *    - Make a Serverless Project dedicated for plugin development, or use an existing Serverless Project
 *    - Make a "plugins" folder in the root of your Project and copy this codebase into it. Title it your custom plugin name with the suffix "-dev", like "myplugin-dev"
 *    - Run "npm link" in your plugin, then run "npm link myplugin" in the root of your project.
 *    - Start developing!
 *
 * - Good luck, serverless.com :)
